# graphql-demo
A basic repo for trying out GraphQL and related technologies, largely based on publicly available tutorials. Master branch here is primarily for basic info storage, though may get a project or two merged to it if any seems significantly better or close to production level best practices. Otherwise, see individual topic branches for info about what they contain.
